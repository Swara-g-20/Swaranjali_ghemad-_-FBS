##Write a program to accept an integer amount from user and tell minimum
#number of notes needed for representing that amount.
amount = int(input("Enter the amount: "))
notes = [100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
count = 0
for note in notes:
    count += amount // note
    amount %= note
print("Minimum number of notes needed:", count)
