##WAP to print all numbers in a range divisible by a given number.

start = int(input("Enter the starting number of the range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the ending number of the range: "))
divisor = int(input("Enter the number by which to check divisibility: "))

for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if num % divisor == 0:
        print(num, end=' ')
